# Orbital-Determination

----- Program Description -----

This repo currently implements 3 Preliminary OD classes (Gibbs, RangeAndAngle, and Gauss-Lambert) as a means to generate the 6 orbital elements (semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, true anomaly, right-ascension of the ascending nodes, and argument of periapsis). And will implement different orbit maneuvers (Hohmann transfer, bi-elliptic transfer).

Within the near future, propagating the states of the orbit will be used to generate 3d visualizations and animations of the orbit.

Above is the base of how the program function where further updates will improve the fidelity by introducing different perturbations (J2, Solar Radiation Pressure, and endo-atmospheric drag). As well as state-estimation tools like an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).

A full roadmap for the project is under the https://github.com/waghraya/Orbital_Mechanics/wiki roadmap page.


----- Steps to run -----

THE REPO IS CURRENTLY NON-FUNCTIONAL AND IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE. ONCE FUNCTIONAL STEPS TO USE IT WILL BE UNDER THIS SECTION.
